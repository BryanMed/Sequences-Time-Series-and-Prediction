# Sequences-Time-Series-and-Prediction
In this repository i'll by uploading my journey in learning how to make prediction of time series data using Machine Learning. Here are some of the resources that i'll be using:
* [Coursera's course of Sequences, time series and prediction provided by Laurence Moroney.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction). 
* [Time Series Forecasting as Supervised Learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-supervised-learning/)
* ... i'll be adding more
